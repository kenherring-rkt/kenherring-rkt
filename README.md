Greetings earthlings ðŸŒŽ!

My name is Ken Herring (He/Him) and I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer @ Rocket Mortgage ðŸš€.

Primarily I find myself developing in OpenEdge, though I dabble in other languages. I enjoy integrating OpenEdge build pipelines with CircleCI and SonarQube in order to ensure quality code via branch protection rules for PRs (AKA quality gates).
